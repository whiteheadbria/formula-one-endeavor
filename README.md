# Welcome to Formula One Endeavor
documenting the 2023 season and improving my coding skills

Welcome to Formula One Endeavor, a website dedicated to recapping the 2023 Formula One season! This is Bria's first website creation and she is excited to showcase her coding skills as she progresses throughout the season. The website will start with the basic schedule and results, but as the season goes on and Bria's programming skills improve, she hopes to add more advanced features such as driver profiles and in-depth analysis of each race.

Formula One Endeavor is a project that Bria has taken on to challenge herself and push her coding skills to the next level. She hopes to not only create a website about Formula One, but also to develop her coding skills in the process. This project represents her commitment to continue learning and improving her skills, despite any challenges she may face.

Join us on this journey as we follow the 2023 Formula One season and witness the growth of Bria's coding skills. Thank you for visiting Formula One Endeavor!
